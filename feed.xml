Rust is the latest programming language to catch my eye and solve a problem that I was encountering. As a member of an IT office, it is incredibly helpful to be able to build simple tools to automate common tasks. However, I’m not exactly in a position to go around installing scripting language runtimes on all the machines that I support so languages like Pytho... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Cross Compiling Rust on a MacBook</title><link href="https://besmith43.github.io/posts/RustCrossCompilation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cross Compiling Rust on a MacBook" /><published>2022-06-17T18:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-12-23T10:49:11-06:00</updated> <id>https://besmith43.github.io/posts/RustCrossCompilation/</id> <content src="https://besmith43.github.io/posts/RustCrossCompilation/" /> <author> <name>Blake Smith</name> </author> <category term="rust" /> <summary> Rustup The main tool for installing rust tools! With it, we can install new “toolchains”. Basically, the parts of the rust compiler needed for platform specific compilation. Unfortunately, because of the way that rust compiles our code into a binary, it needs the appropriate C libraries to be able to produce the final binary that we’ll run on a client computer. In this post, we’ll discuss ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Getting Started with Vim</title><link href="https://besmith43.github.io/posts/VimGettingStarted/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Getting Started with Vim" /><published>2022-06-09T18:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-06-09T18:00:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://besmith43.github.io/posts/VimGettingStarted/</id> <content src="https://besmith43.github.io/posts/VimGettingStarted/" /> <author> <name>Blake Smith</name> </author> <category term="vim" /> <summary> How to Quit? Because Vim is a modal editor, the first question to answer is how to close it. It’s kind of a meme at this point. However you can close vim by pressing “:q” followed by the enter key. This only works if you are in “Normal” mode. Vim has 4 primary modes: Normal, Insert, Visual, and Command. Normal is the default mode and the one that you should spend the most time in. Insert... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Vim All the Things</title><link href="https://besmith43.github.io/posts/VimAllTheThings/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Vim All the Things" /><published>2022-05-29T18:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-06-13T09:39:42-05:00</updated> <id>https://besmith43.github.io/posts/VimAllTheThings/</id> <content src="https://besmith43.github.io/posts/VimAllTheThings/" /> <author> <name>Blake Smith</name> </author> <category term="vim" /> <summary> What is Vim? Vim is a modal text editor. One of the things that makes this complicated user interface great is that it allows the user to capitalize on letting the computer do alot of work for you while keeping your hands on the keyboard’s home rows as much as possible. It’s a command line application by design and therefore doesn’t come out of the box with support for a mouse. Thus you can... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Break and Continue Keywords in .Net Core</title><link href="https://besmith43.github.io/posts/break-continue/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Break and Continue Keywords in .Net Core" /><published>2020-06-27T18:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-06-06T20:37:12-05:00</updated> <id>https://besmith43.github.io/posts/break-continue/</id> <content src="https://besmith43.github.io/posts/break-continue/" /> <author> <name>Blake Smith</name> </author> <category term="c#" /> <summary> Break Break is a keyword that we've seen already with switch statements previously, but what if I told you that you can use break in any loop? Well the first question that may come to mind is why would you want to use it in a loop like a for or a while loop? Additionally you may be asking what does break even do in that context? Both are good questions and very reasonable reactions as up to... </summary> </entry> </feed>
