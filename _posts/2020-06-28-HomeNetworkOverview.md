#### New Equipment!
As this is my first personal blog, I\'m going to keep this relatively short and sweet.  I have recently purchased and deployed a 10th generation i3 Intel NUC.  It is an extremely small form factor pc that I have plugged into my TV as a kind of Apple TV replacement.  Additionally it consumes far less power than my full fat ITX gaming rig.  In the NUC, I have a 256GB Samsung NVMe (which was salvaged from a relative\'s laptop during a hard drive replacement project), and 32GB of G. Skill system ram running at DDR4-2666.  It\'s running Ubuntu 20.04, and I greatly love it as a media PC, but also as a SSH Server.  I\'ll remote into it from work and using a variety of tmux sessions, I have everything that I could want at my fingertips with the only requirement being an active internet connection.  It automounts my Synology NAS\'s network shares, and I just find it all around easier to interface with for a clean, consistent interface that saves me money on my electric bill.  So if you want the full scoop, watch the video.  It\'s alot of talking head, but it shows some pretty cool capabilities.
