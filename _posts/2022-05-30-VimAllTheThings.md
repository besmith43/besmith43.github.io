#### What is Vim?
Vim is a modal text editor.  One of the things that makes this complicated user interface great is that it allows the user to capitalize on letting the computer do alot of work for you while keeping your hands on the keyboard's home rows as much as possible.  It's a command line application by design and therefore doesn't come out of the box with support for a mouse.  Thus you can't/shouldn't need to leave the keyboard to select something with your mouse.  As you get more used to this workflow, it becomes very difficult not to want to use this same modal and keyboard approach to using the computer with everything like web browsers, file browsers, email clients, and all kind of other applications.
